# Databricks Usage Dashboard - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Implementation

All tasks from the plan have been successfully implemented:

### 1. Dependencies Installed ✅

- `@google-cloud/bigquery@^8.1.1` - BigQuery client library
- `recharts@^3.2.1` - Charting library
- `@radix-ui/react-select@^2.2.6` - Select component (via shadcn/ui)
- Card component added via shadcn/ui

### 2. BigQuery Fetch Script Created ✅

**File**: `web/scripts/fetch-databricks-usage.js`

Features:
- Authenticates using service account at `../../everyday-health-pro.json`
- Executes the provided SQL query against BigQuery
- Saves results to `web/public/data/databricks-usage.json`
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Creates data directory if it doesn't exist

### 3. Sidebar Navigation Updated ✅

**File**: `web/src/components/app-sidebar.tsx`

Changes:
- Updated DatabricksUsage URL from `#` to `/databricks-usage`
- Now clickable and navigates to dashboard

### 4. Dashboard Page Created ✅

**File**: `web/src/app/(dashboard)/databricks-usage/page.tsx`

Features implemented:

#### KPI Card
- Displays current year total usage amount
- Formatted with $ and thousands separators
- Shows year-over-year comparison:
  - Last year's total (same period)
  - Percentage change
  - Visual indicators (red for increase, green for decrease)
- Updates based on selected BU filter

#### BU Filter Dropdown
- Shows "All BUs" + all unique BUs from data
- Defaults to "All BUs"
- Filters both KPI and chart

#### Line Chart
- Shows only current year data
- X-axis: year_mon values (e.g., "2025-Jan")
- Y-axis: usage_amount (formatted as $Xk)
- Multiple lines (one per BU)
- Color-coded by BU
- When BU filter is applied, shows only that BU's line
- Responsive sizing
- Interactive tooltips with formatted values
- Legend for BU identification

#### Additional Features
- Loading state while data fetches
- Error handling
- Responsive layout
- Breadcrumb navigation
- Consistent styling with rest of app

### 5. Package Scripts Updated ✅

**File**: `web/package.json`

Added scripts:
```json
"fetch-databricks-data": "node scripts/fetch-databricks-usage.js",
"prebuild": "npm run fetch-databricks-data"
```

The `prebuild` script ensures data is automatically fetched before each production build.

### 6. Sample Data Created ✅

**File**: `web/public/data/databricks-usage.json`

- Sample data structure matches BigQuery output
- Includes data for 2024 and 2025
- Multiple BUs (HeC, Eng, Undefined)
- Ready for development testing

### 7. Documentation Created ✅

**File**: `web/DATABRICKS_USAGE_README.md`

Comprehensive documentation including:
- Setup instructions
- Usage guidelines
- Data fetching methods
- Troubleshooting guide
- Customization options

## Implementation Details

### Data Flow

1. **Build Time**: `npm run fetch-databricks-data` → BigQuery → `databricks-usage.json`
2. **Runtime**: Dashboard loads JSON → Client-side filtering/calculations → Display

### Key Logic

#### Year-over-Year Comparison
```typescript
// Calculates current year total
// Calculates last year total (same period - up to current month)
// Computes percentage change
// Determines if increase or decrease
```

#### Chart Data Transformation
```typescript
// Filters data to current year only
// Groups by month and BU
// Creates data structure for Recharts
// Handles BU filtering
```

```

## Testing the Implementation

### 1. Test Data Fetch (Optional)
```bash
cd web
npm run fetch-databricks-data
```

This will fetch real data from BigQuery if credentials are properly configured.

### 2. Run Development Server
```bash
cd web
npm run dev
```

### 3. Access Dashboard
Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/databricks-usage`

### 4. Test Features
- Click through sidebar navigation
- Verify KPI displays with year-over-year comparison
- Test BU filter dropdown
- Verify chart updates based on filter
- Check chart tooltips and legend
- Test responsive behavior

## Production Build

```bash
cd web
npm run build
```

This will:
1. Automatically run `fetch-databricks-data` (via prebuild)
2. Fetch fresh data from BigQuery
3. Build the Next.js application
4. Bundle everything for production

## Notes

- The dashboard is fully client-side after initial load
- No server requests during browsing (data pre-fetched)
- All calculations (KPI, filtering, charting) happen in browser
- Performance is optimized with React memoization
- Chart is responsive and works on all screen sizes

## Security Considerations

- Service account credentials are kept outside web directory
- Credentials are never bundled or exposed to client
- Data is fetched at build time, not runtime
- No sensitive credentials in client-side code

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Add date range selector
- Export data to CSV
- Additional metrics/KPIs
- More chart types (bar, pie)
- Drill-down capabilities
- Historical trend analysis
