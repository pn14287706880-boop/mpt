# Pro360 Eng Rules CRUD Implementation Summary

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ Database Schema
- Created `pro360_eng_rules` table with SCD Type 2 support
- Added all required fields: eventName, billingType, tacticField, isEngagement, isExposure, isActive, isLatest, version, validFrom, validTo, timestamps, and audit fields
- Implemented database constraints:
  - Unique constraint on (eventName, version)
  - Partial unique index ensuring only one latest record per eventName
  - CHECK constraints for isEngagement, isExposure, version, and date validations
  - Composite indexes for query performance
- Created and applied migration: `0003_add_pro360_eng_rules`

### ✅ API Routes
Created comprehensive REST API endpoints:

1. **GET /api/pro360-eng-rules**
   - Supports query parameters: `history`, `active`, `latest`
   - Default: Returns only active latest records
   - Includes session authentication

2. **POST /api/pro360-eng-rules**
   - Creates new rule (version 1)
   - Validates uniqueness of eventName
   - Validates billingType (CPX, CPE, CPVS)
   - Auto-populates modifiedBy from session user

3. **PUT /api/pro360-eng-rules**
   - Implements SCD Type 2: Creates new version
   - Uses database transaction for atomicity
   - Preserves isActive status and inactivation fields
   - Increments version number

4. **DELETE /api/pro360-eng-rules**
   - Hard delete all versions of a rule (use with caution)

5. **PATCH /api/pro360-eng-rules/toggle-active**
   - Toggles isActive status without creating new version
   - Updates inactivatedAt and inactivatedBy fields
   - Only works on latest versions

6. **GET /api/pro360-eng-rules/history**
   - Returns all versions of a specific eventName

## Key Features Implemented

### SCD Type 2 (Slowly Changing Dimension)
- **Create:** Version 1, isLatest=true, isActive=true
- **Update:** Close current (isLatest=false, validTo=now), create new version (version+1, preserving status)
- **Inactivate:** Update isActive field only, no new version
- **Business Key:** eventName (only one current record per eventName)

### Data Validation
- ✅ EventName required and unique for current records
- ✅ BillingType must be CPX, CPE, or CPVS
- ✅ IsEngagement and IsExposure must be 0 or 1
- ✅ Version tracking and incrementing
- ✅ Temporal validity (validFrom < validTo or validTo IS NULL)

### Security
- ✅ All API endpoints require authentication
- ✅ User identification for audit trail (modifiedBy, inactivatedBy)
- ✅ Database transactions for consistency

### User Experience
- ✅ Modern, attractive UI with shadcn/ui components
- ✅ Toast notifications for all actions
- ✅ Confirmation dialogs for destructive operations
- ✅ Loading states
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Warning messages for edge cases
- ✅ Sortable and resizable columns
- ✅ Row selection
- ✅ Responsive design

WHERE isLatest = true AND isActive = true;
```

### Get all versions of a specific rule:
```sql
SELECT * FROM mpt.pro360_eng_rules 
WHERE eventName = 'bcc_impression' 
ORDER BY version DESC;
```

### Get current rule (latest version):
```sql
SELECT * FROM mpt.pro360_eng_rules 
WHERE eventName = 'bcc_impression' AND isLatest = true;
```

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
