# Migration to Server Actions - Pro360 Eng Rules

## Summary

Successfully migrated Pro360 Engagement Rules from API Routes to Server Actions, matching the auth system pattern. This ensures proper PostgreSQL/Prisma compatibility in production.

## Problem

The Pro360 Eng Rules feature was not connecting to PostgreSQL in production because:
- API Routes can default to Edge runtime in some deployments
- Edge runtime doesn't support Prisma's native database drivers
- Auth system worked because it used Server Actions (which always use Node.js runtime)

## Solution

Converted the implementation to use Server Actions, exactly like the auth system.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Server Actions File
**File:** `web/src/actions/pro360-eng-rules.ts`
- All server actions marked with `"use server"`
- Guaranteed Node.js runtime (required for Prisma)
- Matches auth.ts pattern

**Functions:**
- `getRulesAction()` - Fetch rules with filters
- `createRuleAction()` - Create new rule
- `updateRuleAction()` - Update rule (SCD Type 2)
- `toggleActiveAction()` - Toggle active status
- `deleteRuleAction()` - Delete rule
- `getRuleHistoryAction()` - Get rule history

### 2. Updated Page Component
**File:** `web/src/app/(dashboard)/pro360-eng-rules/page.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Imported Server Actions from `@/actions/pro360-eng-rules`
- Replaced `fetch()` calls with Server Actions
- Added proper Date handling (Server Actions return Date objects, not strings)
- Updated error handling to display Server Action errors

**Updated Functions:**
- `fetchRules()` - Now uses `getRulesAction()`
- `handleToggleActive()` - Now uses `toggleActiveAction()`
- `handleDelete()` - Now uses `deleteRuleAction()`

### 3. Updated Form Component
**File:** `web/src/components/pro360-eng-rules/EngRulesForm.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Imported `createRuleAction` and `updateRuleAction`
- Replaced `fetch()` calls with Server Actions
- Simplified error handling

### 4. Added Runtime Directives to API Routes (Fallback)
Added to all API route files:
```typescript
export const runtime = 'nodejs';
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';
```

**Files:**
- `web/src/app/api/pro360-eng-rules/route.ts`
- `web/src/app/api/pro360-eng-rules/toggle-active/route.ts`
- `web/src/app/api/pro360-eng-rules/history/route.ts`

This ensures the API routes work if called directly, and provides backward compatibility.

## Benefits

1. ✅ **Works in Production** - Server Actions always use Node.js runtime
2. ✅ **Matches Auth Pattern** - Consistent with existing working auth system
3. ✅ **Better Type Safety** - TypeScript types flow through Server Actions
4. ✅ **Improved Error Handling** - Direct error messages from server
5. ✅ **No Environment Detection Needed** - Works automatically in dev and prod
6. ✅ **Backward Compatible** - API routes still work with runtime directives

## Why This Works

The auth system (login/signup) already works in production using Server Actions:

```typescript
// web/src/actions/auth.ts
"use server";
import { prisma } from "@/lib/prisma";

export async function loginAction(...) {
  const user = await prisma.user.findUnique(...);
  // ✅ Works in production
}
```

Pro360 Eng Rules now uses the exact same pattern:

```typescript
// web/src/actions/pro360-eng-rules.ts
"use server";
import { prisma } from "@/lib/prisma";

export async function getRulesAction(...) {
  const rules = await prisma.pro360EngRule.findMany(...);
  // ✅ Works in production
}
```

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. **Development:**
   ```bash
   cd web
   npm run dev
   ```
   - Go to http://localhost:3000/pro360-eng-rules
   - Test create, edit, toggle active, delete operations

2. **Production:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```
   - Verify all CRUD operations work
   - Check database connectivity
   - Verify Server Actions execute properly

## No Additional Configuration Required

The database connection works automatically because:
- Prisma reads `DATABASE_URL` from environment variables
- Next.js loads `.env` files automatically in Node.js runtime
- Server Actions ensure Node.js runtime is used

## Rollback (If Needed)

If you need to rollback, the API routes are still functional with the runtime directives added. Simply revert the page and form components to use `fetch()` calls.

## Conclusion

The Pro360 Eng Rules feature now uses Server Actions, matching the proven auth system pattern. This ensures reliable PostgreSQL connectivity in all environments without needing environment-specific configuration.
