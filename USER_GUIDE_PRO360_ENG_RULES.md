## Troubleshooting

**Q: I can't select a row**
A: Make sure you're clicking the checkbox on the left side of the grid, not just clicking the row.

**Q: Edit button is disabled**
A: You can only edit the latest version. Check if the selected row shows "Historical" status.

**Q: Can't change event name**
A: Event names are immutable after creation. Create a new rule if you need a different event name.

**Q: New version is inactive after editing**
A: The edit preserved the status from the previous version. Click Activate to enable it.

**Q: Don't see any rules**
A: Check if "Active Only" is checked. Uncheck it or toggle "Show History" to see all rules.
